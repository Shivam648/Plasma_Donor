<h2>WHAT IS PLASMA THERAPY ?</h2>
		<p>The therapy aims at using antibodies from the bl ood of a recovered COVID-19 patient to treat those critically infected by the virus. Plasma is a blood component that contains virus-fighting antibodies. It is like blood donation, however, in the same plasma gets separated from the blood and the remaining blood will be transferred back to your body resulting in zero blood loss. The procedure is completely harmless and the donor does not experience any pain, sickness or dizziness..</p>
		<p>Convalescent plasma is the liquid part of blood that is collected from patients who have recovered from the novel coronavirus disease, COVID19, caused by the virus SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 patients develop antibodies in the blood against the virus. Antibodies are proteins that might help fight the infection..</p>
